# GestLink
GestLink is an Industrial Edge Device engineered to bridge the critical safety-productivity gap caused by protective gloves in specialized environments (e.g., cryogenics, sterile zones).

Key Capabilities
Non-Contact Sensing: Reliably detects and classifies hand gestures made while the user is wearing thick, protective industrial gloves.

Edge Classification: Processes sensor data locally on the device (STM32 MCU) to generate a discrete Gesture ID.

Instant Local Feedback: Provides immediate, unambiguous visual confirmation to the user, ensuring low-latency communication.

Data Staging: Prepares the resulting Gesture ID for reliable transmission via communication protocol (following Industry 4.0 standards) over Ethernet to external systems.
